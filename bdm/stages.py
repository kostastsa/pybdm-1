"""Block decomposition stage functions.

Stage functions contain the main logic of the *Block Decomposition Method*
and its different flavours depending on boundary conditions etc.
The implementation follows the *split-apply-combine* approach.
In the first stage an input dataset is partitioned into parts of shape
appropriate for the selected CTM dataset (split stage).
Next, approximate complexity for parts based on the *Coding Theorem Method*
is looked up in the reference (apply stage) dataset.
Finally, values for individual parts are aggregated into a final BDM value
(combine stage).

The partition (split) stage is implemented by the family of ``partition_*`` functions.
The lookup (apply) stage is implemented by the family of ``lookup_*`` functions.
The aggregate (combine) stage is implented by the family of ``aggregate_*`` functions.

The general principle is that specific functions should in most cases
be wrappers around the core family functions, which accordingly are:

* :py:func:`bdm.stages.partition`
* :py:func:`bdm.stages.lookup`
* :py:func:`bdm.stages.aggregate`

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
